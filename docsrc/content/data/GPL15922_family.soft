Samples were centrifuged at 600 xg for 3 min at room temperature to pellet starch. The resulting supernatant was snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80°C for later processing. Upon thawing at room temperature, 10 ml TRIzol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) was added, and the lysates were thoroughly mixed. Samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature before being transferred to MaXtract HD (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) tubes. 2 mL of chloroform was added and mixed again. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, MaXtract HD tubes were centrifuged at 1500 xg for 5 min at room temperature, and the nucleic acid-containing aqueous phase was collected. To extract RNA, samples were processed using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions. To remove contaminating DNA, samples were digested on-column using the RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = Zn limitation was induced by inoculating cells from a nutrient-replete culture to a number of 10^5 cells/ml into 100 ml culture medium without supplemented Zn (“first round culture”), and then into medium without supplemented Zn (“second round culture”). ZnCl2 was resupplied at 2.5 µM to these limited cultures where described when they reached a density of 1 x 10^6 cells/ml (“t0h” of zinc resupply).
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Algae were grown from an inoculum of 1 x 10^5 cells/ml in Tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium containing our revised micronutrient composition (Kropat et al., 2011) at 24°C under continuous light (~90 µmol m-2 s-1) with shaking (180 rpm).  The desired lighting spectra were achieved by mixing 2 cool white fluorescent bulbs at 4100K for each 1 warm white fluorescent bulb at 3000K.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = A volume of culture containing 5 x 10^7 cells was transferred to a 15 ml Falcon tube and centrifuged at 2500 xg for 2 min at room temperature. The supernatant was immediately decanted and the pellets resuspended in 1 ml freshly made lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Samples were centrifuged at 600 xg for 3 min at room temperature to pellet starch. The resulting supernatant was snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80°C for later processing. Upon thawing at room temperature, 10 ml TRIzol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) was added, and the lysates were thoroughly mixed. Samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature before being transferred to MaXtract HD (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) tubes. 2 mL of chloroform was added and mixed again. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, MaXtract HD tubes were centrifuged at 1500 xg for 5 min at room temperature, and the nucleic acid-containing aqueous phase was collected. To extract RNA, samples were processed using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions. To remove contaminating DNA, samples were digested on-column using the RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA samples were subjected to an ethanol precipitation according to standard laboratory protocol (300 mM sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of 100 % ethanol) to remove carry-over contaminants from the QIAgen buffers before being resuspended in 50 µL dH2O.

!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = 30 mL of bioreactor culture was sampled at indicated times and collected by centrifugation.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Cells were innoculated from a plate into a 400 mL PSI FMT-150 photobioreactor cuvette containing HSM medium and grown in 12:12 light-dark conditions (125 uE red light, 125 uE blue light) at 28 degrees C.  The culture was grown to a density corresponding to OD680=0.3 (~2-3e6 daughter cells/mL) and maintained at this density for 3-4 days before sampling.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = total RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.25 mL RNase-free water and then mixed with 0.25 mL warmed (70 C) lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, 1 mg/mL Proteinase K). 10 mL TRIzol was then added and samples were mixed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 C. Samples were later thawed and transfered to 15 mL MaXtract HD tubes followed by extraction with 2 mL chloroform. The aqueous phase was mixed with 1.5 volcumes 100% ethanol and applied to a MicroRNeasy column under vacuum. Washing, DNase treatment, and elution were performed according to manufacturer's instructions (RNase-free DNase Set).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Plate-based RNASeq with polyA selection sample prep was performed on the PerkinElmer Sciclone NGS robotic liquid handling system, where purified mRNA is converted into cDNA library templates of known strand origin for sequencing on the Illumina Sequencer platform. The DynaBead kit (Invitrogen) was used to select and purify poly-A containing mRNA from 5 µg of total RNA per sample. The mRNA was chemically fragmented with 10X fragmentation solution (Ambion) at 70°C for 3 minutes to generate fragments ranging in size between 250 to 300bp. The fragmented RNA was purified using AMpure SPRI beads (Agencourt) using a ratio of 160:100 beads volume: RNA sample volume. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (MBI Fermentas) with Actinomycin D in the master-mix to inhibit DNA dependent DNA synthesis. First-strand synthesis thermocycler conditions were 42°C for 50 minutes and an inactivation step at 70°C for 10 minutes. This was followed by another purification using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 140:100 beads volume:cDNA volume. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using DNA Polymerase I (Invitrogen), RNase H (Invitrogen), and a nucleotide mix containing dUTP (Roche). The second-strand synthesis was done at 16°C for 60 minutes. The double stranded cDNA fragments were purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 75:100 beads volume: cDNA volume followed by a second purification using a bead:cDNA ratio of 140:100. cDNA fragments were end repaired, phosphorylated and A-tailed using a Kapa Biosystems kit followed by ligation to Illumina barcoded sequencing adapters. AmpErase UNG (Uracil N-glycosylase, Applied Biosystems) was added to the double stranded cDNA library fragments and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to cleave and degrade the strand containing dUTP. The single stranded cDNA was then enriched using 10 cycles of PCR with Illumina TruSeq primers and purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 90:100 beads volume: cDNA volume to create the final cDNA library. Libraries were quantified using KAPA Biosystem’s next-generation sequencing library qPCR kit using a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. The libraries were then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform utilizing a TruSeq paired-end cluster kit, v3, and Illumina’s cBot instrument to generate clustered flowcells for sequencing. Sequencing of the flowcells was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit with 200 cycles, v3, following a 2x100 indexed run recipe.
!Sample_data_processing = Quality control of RNA-Seq samples was performed on the raw paired-end reads using Trimmomatic to remove contaminating Illumina adapter sequences and low quality sequences (average Q20 over 4 base slide window<20).
!Sample_data_processing = Reads were aligned to the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome version 5 assembly with STAR version 20201 using standard presets except for intron size that was set between 20 and 3,000 bp (--alignIntronMin 20 & --alignIntronMax 3000).
!Sample_data_processing = Uniquely mapping reads were assigned to 17,737 version 5.3.1 primary transcripts using HT-Seq version 0.5.4p3 (htseq-count --mode intersection-nonempty --type exon --stranded=no).
!Sample_data_processing = One read was added to each sample/gene locus and samples were normalized by library size (# uniquely-mapping reads). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 version 1.4.5 comparing samples to mean expression of all samples. HTSFilter version 1.4.0 was used to establish a low-expression filter of 1.061 reads/million (RPM) and genes with less that 1.061 RPM average expression were excluded from multiple testing correction (FDR). Genes with an absolute fold-change ≥ 2 compared to the mean expression and with a FDR < 0.05 in at least one sample were considered differentially expressed. Expression estimates were then length normalized by primary transcript length into RPKMs.
!Sample_data_processing = Expression estimates were transformed to into standard deviation/mean (z-score). Then K-means Support clustering was performed by MeV version 4.9 on differentially expressed genes to obtain 6 groups of genes with similar expression patterns. These gene sets were then clustered again to obtain a total of 18 groups of differentially-expressed genes.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Plate-based RNASeq with polyA selection sample prep was performed on the PerkinElmer Sciclone NGS robotic liquid handling system, where purified mRNA is converted into cDNA library templates of known strand origin for sequencing on the Illumina Sequencer platform. The DynaBead kit (Invitrogen) was used to select and purify poly-A containing mRNA from 5 µg of total RNA per sample. The mRNA was chemically fragmented with 10X fragmentation solution (Ambion) at 70°C for 3 minutes to generate fragments ranging in size between 250 to 300bp. The fragmented RNA was purified using AMpure SPRI beads (Agencourt) using a ratio of 160:100 beads volume: RNA sample volume. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (MBI Fermentas) with Actinomycin D in the master-mix to inhibit DNA dependent DNA synthesis. First-strand synthesis thermocycler conditions were 42°C for 50 minutes and an inactivation step at 70°C for 10 minutes. This was followed by another purification using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 140:100 beads volume:cDNA volume. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using DNA Polymerase I (Invitrogen), RNase H (Invitrogen), and a nucleotide mix containing dUTP (Roche). The second-strand synthesis was done at 16°C for 60 minutes. The double stranded cDNA fragments were purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 75:100 beads volume: cDNA volume followed by a second purification using a bead:cDNA ratio of 140:100. cDNA fragments were end repaired, phosphorylated and A-tailed using a Kapa Biosystems kit followed by ligation to Illumina barcoded sequencing adapters. AmpErase UNG (Uracil N-glycosylase, Applied Biosystems) was added to the double stranded cDNA library fragments and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to cleave and degrade the strand containing dUTP. The single stranded cDNA was then enriched using 10 cycles of PCR with Illumina TruSeq primers and purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 90:100 beads volume: cDNA volume to create the final cDNA library. Libraries were quantified using KAPA Biosystem’s next-generation sequencing library qPCR kit using a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. The libraries were then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform utilizing a TruSeq paired-end cluster kit, v3, and Illumina’s cBot instrument to generate clustered flowcells for sequencing. Sequencing of the flowcells was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit with 200 cycles, v3, following a 2x100 indexed run recipe.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.25 mL RNase-free water and then mixed with 0.25 mL warmed (70 C) lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, 1 mg/mL Proteinase K). 10 mL TRIzol was then added and samples were mixed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 C. Samples were later thawed and transfered to 15 mL MaXtract HD tubes followed by extraction with 2 mL chloroform. The aqueous phase was mixed with 1.5 volcumes 100% ethanol and applied to a MicroRNeasy column under vacuum. Washing, DNase treatment, and elution were performed according to manufacturer's instructions (RNase-free DNase Set).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Plate-based RNASeq with polyA selection sample prep was performed on the PerkinElmer Sciclone NGS robotic liquid handling system, where purified mRNA is converted into cDNA library templates of known strand origin for sequencing on the Illumina Sequencer platform. The DynaBead kit (Invitrogen) was used to select and purify poly-A containing mRNA from 5 µg of total RNA per sample. The mRNA was chemically fragmented with 10X fragmentation solution (Ambion) at 70°C for 3 minutes to generate fragments ranging in size between 250 to 300bp. The fragmented RNA was purified using AMpure SPRI beads (Agencourt) using a ratio of 160:100 beads volume: RNA sample volume. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (MBI Fermentas) with Actinomycin D in the master-mix to inhibit DNA dependent DNA synthesis. First-strand synthesis thermocycler conditions were 42°C for 50 minutes and an inactivation step at 70°C for 10 minutes. This was followed by another purification using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 140:100 beads volume:cDNA volume. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using DNA Polymerase I (Invitrogen), RNase H (Invitrogen), and a nucleotide mix containing dUTP (Roche). The second-strand synthesis was done at 16°C for 60 minutes. The double stranded cDNA fragments were purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 75:100 beads volume: cDNA volume followed by a second purification using a bead:cDNA ratio of 140:100. cDNA fragments were end repaired, phosphorylated and A-tailed using a Kapa Biosystems kit followed by ligation to Illumina barcoded sequencing adapters. AmpErase UNG (Uracil N-glycosylase, Applied Biosystems) was added to the double stranded cDNA library fragments and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to cleave and degrade the strand containing dUTP. The single stranded cDNA was then enriched using 10 cycles of PCR with Illumina TruSeq primers and purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 90:100 beads volume: cDNA volume to create the final cDNA library. Libraries were quantified using KAPA Biosystem’s next-generation sequencing library qPCR kit using a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. The libraries were then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform utilizing a TruSeq paired-end cluster kit, v3, and Illumina’s cBot instrument to generate clustered flowcells for sequencing. Sequencing of the flowcells was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit with 200 cycles, v3, following a 2x100 indexed run recipe.

!Sample_data_processing = One read was added to each sample/gene locus and samples were normalized by library size (# uniquely-mapping reads). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 version 1.4.5 comparing samples to mean expression of all samples. HTSFilter version 1.4.0 was used to establish a low-expression filter of 1.061 reads/million (RPM) and genes with less that 1.061 RPM average expression were excluded from multiple testing correction (FDR). Genes with an absolute fold-change ≥ 2 compared to the mean expression and with a FDR < 0.05 in at least one sample were considered differentially expressed. Expression estimates were then length normalized by primary transcript length into RPKMs.
!Sample_data_processing = Expression estimates were transformed to into standard deviation/mean (z-score). Then K-means Support clustering was performed by MeV version 4.9 on differentially expressed genes to obtain 6 groups of genes with similar expression patterns.

Samples were later thawed and transfered to 15 mL MaXtract HD tubes followed by extraction with 2 mL chloroform. The aqueous phase was mixed with 1.5 volcumes 100% ethanol and applied to a MicroRNeasy column under vacuum.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Plate-based RNASeq with polyA selection sample prep was performed on the PerkinElmer Sciclone NGS robotic liquid handling system, where purified mRNA is converted into cDNA library templates of known strand origin for sequencing on the Illumina Sequencer platform. The DynaBead kit (Invitrogen) was used to select and purify poly-A containing mRNA from 5 µg of total RNA per sample. The mRNA was chemically fragmented with 10X fragmentation solution (Ambion) at 70°C for 3 minutes to generate fragments ranging in size between 250 to 300bp. The fragmented RNA was purified using AMpure SPRI beads (Agencourt) using a ratio of 160:100 beads volume: RNA sample volume. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (MBI Fermentas) with Actinomycin D in the master-mix to inhibit DNA dependent DNA synthesis. First-strand synthesis thermocycler conditions were 42°C for 50 minutes and an inactivation step at 70°C for 10 minutes. This was followed by another purification using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 140:100 beads volume:cDNA volume. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using DNA Polymerase I (Invitrogen), RNase H (Invitrogen), and a nucleotide mix containing dUTP (Roche). The second-strand synthesis was done at 16°C for 60 minutes. The double stranded cDNA fragments were purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 75:100 beads volume: cDNA volume followed by a second purification using a bead:cDNA ratio of 140:100. cDNA fragments were end repaired, phosphorylated and A-tailed using a Kapa Biosystems kit followed by ligation to Illumina barcoded sequencing adapters. AmpErase UNG (Uracil N-glycosylase, Applied Biosystems) was added to the double stranded cDNA library fragments and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to cleave and degrade the strand containing dUTP. The single stranded cDNA was then enriched using 10 cycles of PCR with Illumina TruSeq primers and purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 90:100 beads volume: cDNA volume to create the final cDNA library. Libraries were quantified using KAPA Biosystem’s next-generation sequencing library qPCR kit using a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. The libraries were then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform utilizing a TruSeq paired-end cluster kit, v3, and Illumina’s cBot instrument to generate clustered flowcells for sequencing. Sequencing of the flowcells was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit with 200 cycles, v3, following a 2x100 indexed run recipe.

First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (MBI Fermentas) with Actinomycin D in the master-mix to inhibit DNA dependent DNA synthesis. First-strand synthesis thermocycler conditions were 42°C for 50 minutes and an inactivation step at 70°C for 10 minutes. This was followed by another purification using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 140:100 beads volume:cDNA volume. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using DNA Polymerase I (Invitrogen), RNase H (Invitrogen), and a nucleotide mix containing dUTP (Roche). The second-strand synthesis was done at 16°C for 60 minutes. The double stranded cDNA fragments were purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 75:100 beads volume: cDNA volume followed by a second purification using a bead:cDNA ratio of 140:100. cDNA fragments were end repaired, phosphorylated and A-tailed using a Kapa Biosystems kit followed by ligation to Illumina barcoded sequencing adapters. AmpErase UNG (Uracil N-glycosylase, Applied Biosystems) was added to the double stranded cDNA library fragments and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to cleave and degrade the strand containing dUTP. The single stranded cDNA was then enriched using 10 cycles of PCR with Illumina TruSeq primers and purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 90:100 beads volume: cDNA volume to create the final cDNA library. Libraries were quantified using KAPA Biosystem’s next-generation sequencing library qPCR kit using a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. The libraries were then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform utilizing a TruSeq paired-end cluster kit, v3, and Illumina’s cBot instrument to generate clustered flowcells for sequencing. Sequencing of the flowcells was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit with 200 cycles, v3, following a 2x100 indexed run recipe.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Plate-based RNASeq with polyA selection sample prep was performed on the PerkinElmer Sciclone NGS robotic liquid handling system, where purified mRNA is converted into cDNA library templates of known strand origin for sequencing on the Illumina Sequencer platform. The DynaBead kit (Invitrogen) was used to select and purify poly-A containing mRNA from 5 µg of total RNA per sample. The mRNA was chemically fragmented with 10X fragmentation solution (Ambion) at 70°C for 3 minutes to generate fragments ranging in size between 250 to 300bp. The fragmented RNA was purified using AMpure SPRI beads (Agencourt) using a ratio of 160:100 beads volume: RNA sample volume. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (MBI Fermentas) with Actinomycin D in the master-mix to inhibit DNA dependent DNA synthesis. First-strand synthesis thermocycler conditions were 42°C for 50 minutes and an inactivation step at 70°C for 10 minutes. This was followed by another purification using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 140:100 beads volume:cDNA volume. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using DNA Polymerase I (Invitrogen), RNase H (Invitrogen), and a nucleotide mix containing dUTP (Roche). The second-strand synthesis was done at 16°C for 60 minutes. The double stranded cDNA fragments were purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 75:100 beads volume: cDNA volume followed by a second purification using a bead:cDNA ratio of 140:100. cDNA fragments were end repaired, phosphorylated and A-tailed using a Kapa Biosystems kit followed by ligation to Illumina barcoded sequencing adapters. AmpErase UNG (Uracil N-glycosylase, Applied Biosystems) was added to the double stranded cDNA library fragments and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to cleave and degrade the strand containing dUTP. The single stranded cDNA was then enriched using 10 cycles of PCR with Illumina TruSeq primers and purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 90:100 beads volume: cDNA volume to create the final cDNA library. Libraries were quantified using KAPA Biosystem’s next-generation sequencing library qPCR kit using a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. The libraries were then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform utilizing a TruSeq paired-end cluster kit, v3, and Illumina’s cBot instrument to generate clustered flowcells for sequencing. Sequencing of the flowcells was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit with 200 cycles, v3, following a 2x100 indexed run recipe.

The culture was grown to a density corresponding to OD680=0.3 (~2-3e6 daughter cells/mL) and maintained at this density for 3-4 days before sampling.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = total RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.25 mL RNase-free water and then mixed with 0.25 mL warmed (70 C) lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, 1 mg/mL Proteinase K). 10 mL TRIzol was then added and samples were mixed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 C. Samples were later thawed and transfered to 15 mL MaXtract HD tubes followed by extraction with 2 mL chloroform. The aqueous phase was mixed with 1.5 volcumes 100% ethanol and applied to a MicroRNeasy column under vacuum. Washing, DNase treatment, and elution were performed according to manufacturer's instructions (RNase-free DNase Set).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Plate-based RNASeq with polyA selection sample prep was performed on the PerkinElmer Sciclone NGS robotic liquid handling system, where purified mRNA is converted into cDNA library templates of known strand origin for sequencing on the Illumina Sequencer platform. The DynaBead kit (Invitrogen) was used to select and purify poly-A containing mRNA from 5 µg of total RNA per sample. The mRNA was chemically fragmented with 10X fragmentation solution (Ambion) at 70°C for 3 minutes to generate fragments ranging in size between 250 to 300bp. The fragmented RNA was purified using AMpure SPRI beads (Agencourt) using a ratio of 160:100 beads volume: RNA sample volume. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (MBI Fermentas) with Actinomycin D in the master-mix to inhibit DNA dependent DNA synthesis. First-strand synthesis thermocycler conditions were 42°C for 50 minutes and an inactivation step at 70°C for 10 minutes. This was followed by another purification using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 140:100 beads volume:cDNA volume. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using DNA Polymerase I (Invitrogen), RNase H (Invitrogen), and a nucleotide mix containing dUTP (Roche). The second-strand synthesis was done at 16°C for 60 minutes. The double stranded cDNA fragments were purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 75:100 beads volume: cDNA volume followed by a second purification using a bead:cDNA ratio of 140:100. cDNA fragments were end repaired, phosphorylated and A-tailed using a Kapa Biosystems kit followed by ligation to Illumina barcoded sequencing adapters. AmpErase UNG (Uracil N-glycosylase, Applied Biosystems) was added to the double stranded cDNA library fragments and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to cleave and degrade the strand containing dUTP. The single stranded cDNA was then enriched using 10 cycles of PCR with Illumina TruSeq primers and purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 90:100 beads volume: cDNA volume to create the final cDNA library. Libraries were quantified using KAPA Biosystem’s next-generation sequencing library qPCR kit using a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. The libraries were then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform utilizing a TruSeq paired-end cluster kit, v3, and Illumina’s cBot instrument to generate clustered flowcells for sequencing. Sequencing of the flowcells was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit with 200 cycles, v3, following a 2x100 indexed run recipe.
!Sample_data_processing = Quality control of RNA-Seq samples was performed on the raw paired-end reads using Trimmomatic to remove contaminating Illumina adapter sequences and low quality sequences (average Q20 over 4 base slide window<20).
!Sample_data_processing = Reads were aligned to the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome version 5 assembly with STAR version 20201 using standard presets except for intron size that was set between 20 and 3,000 bp (--alignIntronMin 20 & --alignIntronMax 3000).
!Sample_data_processing = Uniquely mapping reads were assigned to 17,737 version 5.3.1 primary transcripts using HT-Seq version 0.5.4p3 (htseq-count --mode intersection-nonempty --type exon --stranded=no).
!Sample_data_processing = One read was added to each sample/gene locus and samples were normalized by library size (# uniquely-mapping reads). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 version 1.4.5 comparing samples to mean expression of all samples. HTSFilter version 1.4.0 was used to establish a low-expression filter of 1.061 reads/million (RPM) and genes with less that 1.061 RPM average expression were excluded from multiple testing correction (FDR). Genes with an absolute fold-change ≥ 2 compared to the mean expression and with a FDR < 0.05 in at least one sample were considered differentially expressed. Expression estimates were then length normalized by primary transcript length into RPKMs.
!Sample_data_processing = Expression estimates were transformed to into standard deviation/mean (z-score). Then K-means Support clustering was performed by MeV version 4.9 on differentially expressed genes to obtain 6 groups of genes with similar expression patterns. These gene sets were then clustered again to obtain a total of 18 groups of differentially-expressed genes.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Plate-based RNASeq with polyA selection sample prep was performed on the PerkinElmer Sciclone NGS robotic liquid handling system, where purified mRNA is converted into cDNA library templates of known strand origin for sequencing on the Illumina Sequencer platform. The DynaBead kit (Invitrogen) was used to select and purify poly-A containing mRNA from 5 µg of total RNA per sample. The mRNA was chemically fragmented with 10X fragmentation solution (Ambion) at 70°C for 3 minutes to generate fragments ranging in size between 250 to 300bp. The fragmented RNA was purified using AMpure SPRI beads (Agencourt) using a ratio of 160:100 beads volume: RNA sample volume. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (MBI Fermentas) with Actinomycin D in the master-mix to inhibit DNA dependent DNA synthesis. First-strand synthesis thermocycler conditions were 42°C for 50 minutes and an inactivation step at 70°C for 10 minutes. This was followed by another purification using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 140:100 beads volume:cDNA volume. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using DNA Polymerase I (Invitrogen), RNase H (Invitrogen), and a nucleotide mix containing dUTP (Roche). The second-strand synthesis was done at 16°C for 60 minutes. The double stranded cDNA fragments were purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 75:100 beads volume: cDNA volume followed by a second purification using a bead:cDNA ratio of 140:100. cDNA fragments were end repaired, phosphorylated and A-tailed using a Kapa Biosystems kit followed by ligation to Illumina barcoded sequencing adapters. AmpErase UNG (Uracil N-glycosylase, Applied Biosystems) was added to the double stranded cDNA library fragments and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to cleave and degrade the strand containing dUTP. The single stranded cDNA was then enriched using 10 cycles of PCR with Illumina TruSeq primers and purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 90:100 beads volume: cDNA volume to create the final cDNA library. Libraries were quantified using KAPA Biosystem’s next-generation sequencing library qPCR kit using a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. The libraries were then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform utilizing a TruSeq paired-end cluster kit, v3, and Illumina’s cBot instrument to generate clustered flowcells for sequencing. Sequencing of the flowcells was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit with 200 cycles, v3, following a 2x100 indexed run recipe.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.25 mL RNase-free water and then mixed with 0.25 mL warmed (70 C) lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, 1 mg/mL Proteinase K). 10 mL TRIzol was then added and samples were mixed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 C. Samples were later thawed and transfered to 15 mL MaXtract HD tubes followed by extraction with 2 mL chloroform. The aqueous phase was mixed with 1.5 volcumes 100% ethanol and applied to a MicroRNeasy column under vacuum. Washing, DNase treatment, and elution were performed according to manufacturer's instructions (RNase-free DNase Set).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Plate-based RNASeq with polyA selection sample prep was performed on the PerkinElmer Sciclone NGS robotic liquid handling system, where purified mRNA is converted into cDNA library templates of known strand origin for sequencing on the Illumina Sequencer platform. The DynaBead kit (Invitrogen) was used to select and purify poly-A containing mRNA from 5 µg of total RNA per sample. The mRNA was chemically fragmented with 10X fragmentation solution (Ambion) at 70°C for 3 minutes to generate fragments ranging in size between 250 to 300bp. The fragmented RNA was purified using AMpure SPRI beads (Agencourt) using a ratio of 160:100 beads volume: RNA sample volume. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (MBI Fermentas) with Actinomycin D in the master-mix to inhibit DNA dependent DNA synthesis. First-strand synthesis thermocycler conditions were 42°C for 50 minutes and an inactivation step at 70°C for 10 minutes. This was followed by another purification using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 140:100 beads volume:cDNA volume. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using DNA Polymerase I (Invitrogen), RNase H (Invitrogen), and a nucleotide mix containing dUTP (Roche). The second-strand synthesis was done at 16°C for 60 minutes. The double stranded cDNA fragments were purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 75:100 beads volume: cDNA volume followed by a second purification using a bead:cDNA ratio of 140:100. cDNA fragments were end repaired, phosphorylated and A-tailed using a Kapa Biosystems kit followed by ligation to Illumina barcoded sequencing adapters. AmpErase UNG (Uracil N-glycosylase, Applied Biosystems) was added to the double stranded cDNA library fragments and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to cleave and degrade the strand containing dUTP. The single stranded cDNA was then enriched using 10 cycles of PCR with Illumina TruSeq primers and purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 90:100 beads volume: cDNA volume to create the final cDNA library. Libraries were quantified using KAPA Biosystem’s next-generation sequencing library qPCR kit using a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. The libraries were then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform utilizing a TruSeq paired-end cluster kit, v3, and Illumina’s cBot instrument to generate clustered flowcells for sequencing. Sequencing of the flowcells was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit with 200 cycles, v3, following a 2x100 indexed run recipe.

!Sample_data_processing = One read was added to each sample/gene locus and samples were normalized by library size (# uniquely-mapping reads). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 version 1.4.5 comparing samples to mean expression of all samples. HTSFilter version 1.4.0 was used to establish a low-expression filter of 1.061 reads/million (RPM) and genes with less that 1.061 RPM average expression were excluded from multiple testing correction (FDR). Genes with an absolute fold-change ≥ 2 compared to the mean expression and with a FDR < 0.05 in at least one sample were considered differentially expressed. Expression estimates were then length normalized by primary transcript length into RPKMs.
!Sample_data_processing = Expression estimates were transformed to into standard deviation/mean (z-score). Then K-means Support clustering was performed by MeV version 4.9 on differentially expressed genes to obtain 6 groups of genes with similar expression patterns.

The DynaBead kit (Invitrogen) was used to select and purify poly-A containing mRNA from 5 µg of total RNA per sample. The mRNA was chemically fragmented with 10X fragmentation solution (Ambion) at 70°C for 3 minutes to generate fragments ranging in size between 250 to 300bp. The fragmented RNA was purified using AMpure SPRI beads (Agencourt) using a ratio of 160:100 beads volume: RNA sample volume. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (MBI Fermentas) with Actinomycin D in the master-mix to inhibit DNA dependent DNA synthesis. First-strand synthesis thermocycler conditions were 42°C for 50 minutes and an inactivation step at 70°C for 10 minutes.

AmpErase UNG (Uracil N-glycosylase, Applied Biosystems) was added to the double stranded cDNA library fragments and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to cleave and degrade the strand containing dUTP. The single stranded cDNA was then enriched using 10 cycles of PCR with Illumina TruSeq primers and purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 90:100 beads volume: cDNA volume to create the final cDNA library. Libraries were quantified using KAPA Biosystem’s next-generation sequencing library qPCR kit using a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. The libraries were then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform utilizing a TruSeq paired-end cluster kit, v3, and Illumina’s cBot instrument to generate clustered flowcells for sequencing. Sequencing of the flowcells was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit with 200 cycles, v3, following a 2x100 indexed run recipe.

The double stranded cDNA fragments were purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 75:100 beads volume: cDNA volume followed by a second purification using a bead:cDNA ratio of 140:100. cDNA fragments were end repaired, phosphorylated and A-tailed using a Kapa Biosystems kit followed by ligation to Illumina barcoded sequencing adapters. AmpErase UNG (Uracil N-glycosylase, Applied Biosystems) was added to the double stranded cDNA library fragments and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to cleave and degrade the strand containing dUTP. The single stranded cDNA was then enriched using 10 cycles of PCR with Illumina TruSeq primers and purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 90:100 beads volume: cDNA volume to create the final cDNA library. Libraries were quantified using KAPA Biosystem’s next-generation sequencing library qPCR kit using a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. The libraries were then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform utilizing a TruSeq paired-end cluster kit, v3, and Illumina’s cBot instrument to generate clustered flowcells for sequencing. Sequencing of the flowcells was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit with 200 cycles, v3, following a 2x100 indexed run recipe.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Plate-based RNASeq with polyA selection sample prep was performed on the PerkinElmer Sciclone NGS robotic liquid handling system, where purified mRNA is converted into cDNA library templates of known strand origin for sequencing on the Illumina Sequencer platform. The DynaBead kit (Invitrogen) was used to select and purify poly-A containing mRNA from 5 µg of total RNA per sample. The mRNA was chemically fragmented with 10X fragmentation solution (Ambion) at 70°C for 3 minutes to generate fragments ranging in size between 250 to 300bp. The fragmented RNA was purified using AMpure SPRI beads (Agencourt) using a ratio of 160:100 beads volume: RNA sample volume. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (MBI Fermentas) with Actinomycin D in the master-mix to inhibit DNA dependent DNA synthesis. First-strand synthesis thermocycler conditions were 42°C for 50 minutes and an inactivation step at 70°C for 10 minutes. This was followed by another purification using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 140:100 beads volume:cDNA volume. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using DNA Polymerase I (Invitrogen), RNase H (Invitrogen), and a nucleotide mix containing dUTP (Roche). The second-strand synthesis was done at 16°C for 60 minutes. The double stranded cDNA fragments were purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 75:100 beads volume: cDNA volume followed by a second purification using a bead:cDNA ratio of 140:100. cDNA fragments were end repaired, phosphorylated and A-tailed using a Kapa Biosystems kit followed by ligation to Illumina barcoded sequencing adapters. AmpErase UNG (Uracil N-glycosylase, Applied Biosystems) was added to the double stranded cDNA library fragments and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to cleave and degrade the strand containing dUTP. The single stranded cDNA was then enriched using 10 cycles of PCR with Illumina TruSeq primers and purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 90:100 beads volume: cDNA volume to create the final cDNA library. Libraries were quantified using KAPA Biosystem’s next-generation sequencing library qPCR kit using a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. The libraries were then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform utilizing a TruSeq paired-end cluster kit, v3, and Illumina’s cBot instrument to generate clustered flowcells for sequencing. Sequencing of the flowcells was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit with 200 cycles, v3, following a 2x100 indexed run recipe.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.25 mL RNase-free water and then mixed with 0.25 mL warmed (70 C) lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, 1 mg/mL Proteinase K). 10 mL TRIzol was then added and samples were mixed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 C. Samples were later thawed and transfered to 15 mL MaXtract HD tubes followed by extraction with 2 mL chloroform. The aqueous phase was mixed with 1.5 volcumes 100% ethanol and applied to a MicroRNeasy column under vacuum. Washing, DNase treatment, and elution were performed according to manufacturer's instructions (RNase-free DNase Set).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Plate-based RNASeq with polyA selection sample prep was performed on the PerkinElmer Sciclone NGS robotic liquid handling system, where purified mRNA is converted into cDNA library templates of known strand origin for sequencing on the Illumina Sequencer platform. The DynaBead kit (Invitrogen) was used to select and purify poly-A containing mRNA from 5 µg of total RNA per sample. The mRNA was chemically fragmented with 10X fragmentation solution (Ambion) at 70°C for 3 minutes to generate fragments ranging in size between 250 to 300bp. The fragmented RNA was purified using AMpure SPRI beads (Agencourt) using a ratio of 160:100 beads volume: RNA sample volume. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (MBI Fermentas) with Actinomycin D in the master-mix to inhibit DNA dependent DNA synthesis. First-strand synthesis thermocycler conditions were 42°C for 50 minutes and an inactivation step at 70°C for 10 minutes. This was followed by another purification using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 140:100 beads volume:cDNA volume. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using DNA Polymerase I (Invitrogen), RNase H (Invitrogen), and a nucleotide mix containing dUTP (Roche). The second-strand synthesis was done at 16°C for 60 minutes. The double stranded cDNA fragments were purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 75:100 beads volume: cDNA volume followed by a second purification using a bead:cDNA ratio of 140:100. cDNA fragments were end repaired, phosphorylated and A-tailed using a Kapa Biosystems kit followed by ligation to Illumina barcoded sequencing adapters. AmpErase UNG (Uracil N-glycosylase, Applied Biosystems) was added to the double stranded cDNA library fragments and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to cleave and degrade the strand containing dUTP. The single stranded cDNA was then enriched using 10 cycles of PCR with Illumina TruSeq primers and purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 90:100 beads volume: cDNA volume to create the final cDNA library. Libraries were quantified using KAPA Biosystem’s next-generation sequencing library qPCR kit using a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. The libraries were then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform utilizing a TruSeq paired-end cluster kit, v3, and Illumina’s cBot instrument to generate clustered flowcells for sequencing. Sequencing of the flowcells was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit with 200 cycles, v3, following a 2x100 indexed run recipe.

!Sample_data_processing = Uniquely mapping reads were assigned to 17,737 version 5.3.1 primary transcripts using HT-Seq version 0.5.4p3 (htseq-count --mode intersection-nonempty --type exon --stranded=no).
!Sample_data_processing = One read was added to each sample/gene locus and samples were normalized by library size (# uniquely-mapping reads). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 version 1.4.5 comparing samples to mean expression of all samples. HTSFilter version 1.4.0 was used to establish a low-expression filter of 1.061 reads/million (RPM) and genes with less that 1.061 RPM average expression were excluded from multiple testing correction (FDR). Genes with an absolute fold-change ≥ 2 compared to the mean expression and with a FDR < 0.05 in at least one sample were considered differentially expressed. Expression estimates were then length normalized by primary transcript length into RPKMs.
!Sample_data_processing = Expression estimates were transformed to into standard deviation/mean (z-score). Then K-means Support clustering was performed by MeV version 4.9 on differentially expressed genes to obtain 6 groups of genes with similar expression patterns. These gene sets were then clustered again to obtain a total of 18 groups of differentially-expressed genes.

Samples were later thawed and transfered to 15 mL MaXtract HD tubes followed by extraction with 2 mL chloroform. The aqueous phase was mixed with 1.5 volcumes 100% ethanol and applied to a MicroRNeasy column under vacuum. Washing, DNase treatment, and elution were performed according to manufacturer's instructions (RNase-free DNase Set).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Plate-based RNASeq with polyA selection sample prep was performed on the PerkinElmer Sciclone NGS robotic liquid handling system, where purified mRNA is converted into cDNA library templates of known strand origin for sequencing on the Illumina Sequencer platform. The DynaBead kit (Invitrogen) was used to select and purify poly-A containing mRNA from 5 µg of total RNA per sample. The mRNA was chemically fragmented with 10X fragmentation solution (Ambion) at 70°C for 3 minutes to generate fragments ranging in size between 250 to 300bp. The fragmented RNA was purified using AMpure SPRI beads (Agencourt) using a ratio of 160:100 beads volume: RNA sample volume. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (MBI Fermentas) with Actinomycin D in the master-mix to inhibit DNA dependent DNA synthesis. First-strand synthesis thermocycler conditions were 42°C for 50 minutes and an inactivation step at 70°C for 10 minutes. This was followed by another purification using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 140:100 beads volume:cDNA volume. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using DNA Polymerase I (Invitrogen), RNase H (Invitrogen), and a nucleotide mix containing dUTP (Roche). The second-strand synthesis was done at 16°C for 60 minutes. The double stranded cDNA fragments were purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 75:100 beads volume: cDNA volume followed by a second purification using a bead:cDNA ratio of 140:100. cDNA fragments were end repaired, phosphorylated and A-tailed using a Kapa Biosystems kit followed by ligation to Illumina barcoded sequencing adapters. AmpErase UNG (Uracil N-glycosylase, Applied Biosystems) was added to the double stranded cDNA library fragments and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to cleave and degrade the strand containing dUTP. The single stranded cDNA was then enriched using 10 cycles of PCR with Illumina TruSeq primers and purified using AMpure SPRI beads at a ratio of 90:100 beads volume: cDNA volume to create the final cDNA library. Libraries were quantified using KAPA Biosystem’s next-generation sequencing library qPCR kit using a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. The libraries were then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform utilizing a TruSeq paired-end cluster kit, v3, and Illumina’s cBot instrument to generate clustered flowcells for sequencing. Sequencing of the flowcells was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit with 200 cycles, v3, following a 2x100 indexed run recipe.

!Series_summary = Here we show that the phytochrome-less chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii retains a functional pathway to synthesize the linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) precursor of the phytochrome chromophore. Reverse genetic, metabolic inactivation and bilin rescue experiments establish that this pathway is needed for heme iron acquisition and for the diurnal transition to phototrophic growth. RNA-Seq measurements reveal a bilin-dependent signaling network that is necessary for the heterotrophic to phototrophic transition. These results imply the presence of a novel bilin sensor pathway that may be widely distributed amongst oxygenic photosynthetic organisms.
!Series_overall_design = We isolated RNA from heterotrophic suspension cultures of 4A+ WT and the hmox1 mutant grown in the presence or absence of 0.1 mM BV IXα before and after transfer to low light.

!Series_summary = C. reinhardtii cells exposed to abiotic stresses (e.g. iron-, nitrogen-, zinc- or phosphorus-deficiency) accumulate TAGs which are stored in lipid droplets. Here, we report that iron starvation leads to formation of lipids bodies and accumulation of TAGs. This occurs between 12 and 24 h of iron-starvation. C. reinhardtii cells deprived for iron have more saturated FA, due to the loss of functional FA desaturases, which are diiron enzymes. The abundance of a plastid ACP-acyl desaturase (FAB2) is significantly decreased to the same degree as observed for ferredoxin, which is a substrate of the desaturases. The increase in saturated FA (C16:0 and C18:0) is concomitant with the decrease in saturated FA (C16:4, C18:3 or C18:4). This pattern was observed for MGDG, DGTS or DGDG. When we monitored the absolute levels of glycerolipids, MGDG content dropped significantly after only 2 h of iron-starvation. On the other hand, DGTS and DGDG contents gradually decrease until a minimum is reached after 24-48 h of iron-deprivation. RNA-Seq analysis of iron-starved C. reinhardtii cells revealed significant changes in many transcripts coding for enzymes involved in FA metabolism. The mRNA abundances of genes coding for components involved in TAG accumulation (DGAT or MLDP) are increased. A more dramatic increase at the transcript level has been observed for many lipases, suggesting that a major remodeling of lipid membranes occurs during iron-starvation in C. reinhardtii.
!Series_overall_design = Sampling of Chlamydomonas CC-4532 (2137) cells cultivated photoheterotrophically (TAP) under iron-starvation condition (0 uM Fe-EDTA). Samples were collected from biological duplicates after washing in TAP medium lacking Fe at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours.

!Series_summary = When the sta6 (starch-null) strain of the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is nitrogen-starved in acetate and then "boosted" after two days with additional acetate, the cells become "obese" after eight days, with triacylglyceride-filled lipid bodies filling their cytoplasm and chloroplasts. To assess the transcriptional correlates of this response, sta6 and the starch-forming cw15 strain were subjected to RNA-Seq analysis during the two days prior and two days post boost, and the data were compared with published reports using other strains and growth conditions. During the two hours post boost, ~425 genes are up-regulated ≥2-fold and ~875 genes are down-regulated ≥2-fold in each strain. Expression of a small subset of "sensitive" genes, encoding enzymes in the glyoxylate and Calvin Benson cycles, gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway, is responsive to culture conditions and genetic background as well as to boost. Four genes--encoding a diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGTT2), a glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase (GPD3), and two candidate lipases (Cre03.g155250 and Cre17.g735600)--are selectively up-regulated in sta6. Although the bulk rate of acetate depletion from the medium is not boost-enhanced, three candidate acetate permease-encoding genes in the GPR1_FUN34_YaaH superfamily are boost-up-regulated, and 13 of the "sensitive" genes are strongly responsive to the cell's acetate status. A cohort of 64 autophagy-related genes is down-regulated by boost. Our results indicate that the boost serves both to avert an autophagy program and to prolong the operation of key pathways that shuttle carbon from acetate into storage lipid, the combined outcome being enhanced TAG accumulation, notably in sta6.
!Series_overall_design = Here we report studies on gene-expression patterns during the path to obesity. The Merchant/Pellegrini and Los Alamos laboratories recently generated and analyzed RNA-Seq transcriptomes of cw15, sta6, and several complemented sta6 strains during two days of N-starvation (0→48 h). In collaboration with these groups, the Goodenough lab generated a second pair of transcriptomes using cw15 and sta6, tracing 0→48 h gene expression patterns under a different set of culture conditions and taking the time course out to 96 h, with an intervening acetate boost. Analysis of these data was deeply informed by cross-comparisons with the Blaby et al. data. Three additional RNA-Seq studies of wild-type strains were also considered.

!Series_summary = Alga-derived lipids represent an attractive potential source of biofuels. However, lipid accumulation in algae is a stress response tightly coupled to growth arrest, thereby imposing a major limitation on productivity. To identify master regulators of lipid accumulation and decipher the regulation of lipid biosynthetic pathway, we performed an integrative chromatin signature and transcriptomic analysis in the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Genome-wide histone modification profiling revealed remarkable differences in functional chromatin states between algae and higher eukaryotes and uncovered regulatory components at the core of lipid accumulation pathways. We identified the transcription factor PSR1 as a pivotal master switch that triggers cytosolic lipid hyper-accumulation an order of magnitude higher than stress regimens have achieved. Dissection of the PSR1 target network corroborates its central role in coordinating multiple stress responses. The comprehensive maps of functional chromatin signatures in a major clade of eukaryotic life and the discovery of a central regulator of algal lipid metabolism will facilitate targeted engineering strategies in microalgae.

!Series_summary = N6-methyldeoxyadenosine (6mA or m6A) is a DNA modification preserved in prokaryotes to eukaryotes. It is widespread in bacteria, and functions in DNA mismatch repair, chromosome segregation, and virulence regulation. In contrast, the distribution and function of 6mA in eukaryotes have been unclear. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the 6mA landscape in the genome of Chlamydomonas using new sequencing approaches. We identified the 6mA modification in 84% of genes in Chlamydomonas. We found that 6mA mainly locates at ApT dinucleotides around transcription start sites (TSS) with a bimodal distribution, and appears to mark active genes. A periodic pattern of 6mA deposition was also observed at base resolution, which is associated with nucleosome distribution near the TSS, suggesting a possible role in nucleosome positioning. The new genome-wide mapping of 6mA and its unique distribution in the Chlamydomonas genome suggest potential regulatory roles of 6mA in gene expression in eukaryotic organisms.
!Series_overall_design = Multiple sequencing methods are developed to profile the distribution of 6mA in Chlamydomonas including MeDIP-Seq, enzyme-treated DNA-Seq, MNase-Seq and RNA-Seq.

!Series_summary = Linear tetrapyrrole (bilin)-based phytochrome sensors optimize photosynthetic light capture by mediating massive gene reprogramming in land plants, yet surprisingly, many sequenced chlorophyte (green) algae lack phytochrome genes. Previous studies on the heme oxygenase (hmox1) mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii suggest that bilin biosynthesis in plastids is needed for regulation of a limited nuclear gene network implicated in oxygen detoxification during dark to light transitions. The hmox1 mutant is unable to grow photoautotrophically and poorly acclimates to increased illumination even in the presence of acetate. Here we show that these phenotypes reflect the reduced accumulation of PSI reaction centers as well as a loss of PSI and PSII antennae complexes during photoacclimation. Phenotypically, the hmox1 mutant is similar to the chlorophyll biosynthesis mutants, gun4, crd1 and cth1. However, many of the hmox1 phenotypes can be rescued by the application of exogenous biliverdin IXα, the bilin product of HMOX1; this rescue is independent of photosynthesis but strongly dependent upon blue light. RNA-Seq comparisons of hmox1, 4A+ wild type and two genetically complemented lines also reveal that bilins restore regulation of a small network of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes. These include genes responsible for chlorophyll biosynthesis (CHLI1/2), PSI light-harvesting (LHCA4) and naphthoquinone metabolism (MEN2), all of which show reduced photoinduction in the hmox1 mutant. We propose that a bilin-based, blue light sensory system is responsible for the maintenance of a functional photosynthetic apparatus in light-grown C. reinhardtii. This critical and possibly ancestral role for bilins may be responsible for retention of bilin biosynthesis in all eukaryotic photosynthetic species.
!Series_overall_design = We isolated RNA from heterotrophic suspension cultures of 4A+ WT and the hmox1 mutant grown in the presence or absence of 0.1 mM BV IXα before and after transfer to low light.

!Series_summary = Here, we report a transcriptomics analysis on a day in the life of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Cultures of this unicellular alga were grown in photobioreactors on a 12 h light / 12 h dark cycle. Samples were collected at regular intervals and subjected to a transcriptomics analysis by RNA-Seq.
!Series_overall_design = RNA-Seq libraries were prepared from synchronized cultures of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii sampled at regular intervals over the course of a diurnal cycle. Light intensity during the day was 200 PFD.
